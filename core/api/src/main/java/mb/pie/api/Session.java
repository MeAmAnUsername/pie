 * A session is a temporary context in which PIE builds can be executed. Within a session, a task with the same {@link

 * <ul>
 * <li>Change to the contents or metadata of a required or provided resource (e.g., file contents)</li>
 * <li>Change to the input of a required task, which does not influence its {@link Task#key() key}</li>
 * <li>
 * Change to the {@link OutTransient#getValue() value} or {@link OutTransient#isConsistent() consistency} values of an
 * {@link OutTransient} output of a task
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Change to the {@link OutTransientEquatable#getEquatableValue() equatable value} of an {@link OutTransientEquatable}
